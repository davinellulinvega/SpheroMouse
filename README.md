# SpheroMouse
A python 2.7 script that let you use sphero 2.0 as a mouse for your computer.

For the script to work, you need to have installed:
  + pyautogui
  + sphero_driver
  + python-xlib
  
To install pyautogui and python-xlib on a linux system just enter the following commands in a terminal:
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-xlib
sudo pip install pyautogui
</code></pre>

The sphero_driver can be downloaded from Mmwise sphero_ros project (https://github.com/mmwise/sphero_ros).

Any feedback or improvement is welcomed!!!
